# COSC 367 Artificial Intelligence

## Description

This course introduces important concepts in computational intelligence and demonstrates how they are used to solve problems that are normally difficult or intractable by conventional means. Topics covered include algorithms, techniques, and languages commonly used in artificial intelligence, knowledge representations and reasoning, and bio-inspired computing.

***

In this course you will learn about a set of techniques and methodologies that aim to produce computer programs that show aspects of intelligence present in humans and other animals. The collection of these techniques and methodologies that come from a variety of fields (such as mathematics, biology, neuroscience, philosophy, algorithms, operational research, statistics, control, ...) form a field that is called, for historical reasons, Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The course covers core topics in AI including:

- uninformed and informed graph search algorithms,
- propositional logic and forward and backward chaining algorithms,
- declarative programming with Prolog,
- the min-max and alpha-beta pruning algorithms,
- Bayesian networks and probabilistic inference algorithms,
- classification learning algorithms,
- consistency algorithms,
- local search and heuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing, and population-based algorithms such as genetic search and swarm optimisation.

## Learning Outcomes

Having successfully completed the course, you will be able to:

- identify problems that are amenable to transformation into state-space graphs, create these graphs, and use known search techniques and algorithms to solve them;

- understand how logical inference can be achieved by computation and implement the related algorithms;

- create knowledge bases consisting of facts and rules about a domain and use appropriate algorithms to reason about objects in the domain;
 
- understand the declarative paradigm in problem solving and write programs in one of the languages in this paradigm;
 
- implement optimal algorithms to play games or solve any real-world problem where the process of decision making can be modelled as a turn-based zero-sum game;

- design and implement probabilistic networks and related algorithms in order to solve problems involving uncertain inputs, knowledge, or outcomes;

- apply basic machine learning algorithms to real datasets to build predictive models for tasks such as spam filters;

- create constraint networks for various problems that involve constraints and implement different algorithms to solve these problems; and

- recognise situations where due to the size or structure of the search space of an optimisation problem, classical approaches are not feasible and choose and apply an appropriate heuristic algorithm to attempt to solve the problem.
